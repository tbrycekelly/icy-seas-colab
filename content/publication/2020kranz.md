abstract = "A multimethod process-oriented investigation of diverse productivity measures in the California Current Ecosystem (CCE) Long-Term Ecological Research study region, a complex physical environment, is presented. Seven multiday deployments covering a transition region from high to low productivity were conducted over two field expeditions (spring 2016 and summer 2017). Employing a Lagrangian study design, water parcels were followed over several days, comparing 24-h in situ measurements (14C and 15NO3 -uptake, dilution estimates of phytoplankton growth, and microzooplankton grazing) with high-resolution productivity measurements by fast repetition rate fluorometry (FRRF) and equilibrium inlet mass spectrometry (EIMS), and integrated carbon export measuremnts using sediment traps. Results show the importance of accounting for temporal and fine spatial scale variability when estimating ecosystem production. FRRF and EIMS measurements resolved diel patterns in gross primary and net community production. Diel productivity changes agreed well with comparably more traditional measurements. While differences in productivity metrics calculated over different time intervals were considerable, as those methods rely on different base assumptions, the data can be used to explain ecosystem processes which would otherwise have gone unnoticed. The processes resolved from this method comparison further understanding of temporal and spatial coupling and decoupling of surface productivity and potential carbon burial in a gradient from coastal to offshore ecosystems."

## Key Points
- We employ a Lagrangian observation of diverse productivity measurements in the California Current
- Temporally highly resolved productivity, based on optical and mass spectrometric methods, was comparable with traditional in situ 24-h assays
- We suggest that temporally resolved production methods be employed regularly to enhance understanding of physically complex ecosystems

## Plain Language Summary
The California Current Ecosystem (CCE) is a site of coastal upwelling and is among the most productive ecosystems in the world oceans, supporting fisheries of much of the western United States, while playing a vital role in the economy of coastal communities. Accurately assessing marine productivity in such regions is important for understanding the flux of carbon through the food web and the ocean's ability to sequester carbon dioxide. Productivity assessments are, however, often based on different methodologies relying on distinct cellular or ecosystem assumptions. Each individual method can thus be misleading if its assumptions are not met, while any single method is likely to fall short in terms of explaining ecosystem dynamics. Here, we present a multimethod process-oriented investigation of diverse productivity methods in the CCE Long-Term Ecological Research study region. Traditional 24-h in situ incubation methods were compared with high temporal resolution measurements using advanced optical and mass spectrometric methods. The productivity rates and ecosystem processes resolved presented here can help to further our understanding of the linkages between photosynthesis and respiration or carbon production and sequestration. This approach can also help to improve productivity assessments in complex ecosystems and to resolve the timescales of these processes.
