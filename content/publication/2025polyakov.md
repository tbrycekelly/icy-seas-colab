abstract = "Atlantification—the northward inflow of anomalous waters and biota from the Atlantic into the polar basins—has wide-ranging climatological ramifications. We present previously unknown observational evidence that the atlantification processes are strengthening in the eastern Eurasian Basin. The primary example is the diminishing sea ice, which is related to a powerful ocean-heat/ice-albedo feedback, which accelerates sea-ice losses. Furthermore, we observe that atlantification is extending far beyond the Lomonosov Ridge into the Makarov Basin of the Arctic Ocean where upper ocean ventilation creates a new and unique ecological environment. The eastern part of the Siberian Arctic Ocean is still strongly stratified, but the atlantification-driven shoaling of warm, salty, and nutrient-rich intermediate waters already has important ecological consequences there. Disentangling the role of atlantification in multiple and complex high-latitude changes should be a priority in future modeling and observational efforts."
