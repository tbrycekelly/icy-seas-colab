abstract = "Photosynthesis in the surface ocean and subsequent export of a fraction of this fixed carbon leads to carbon dioxide sequestration in the deep ocean. Ecological relationships among plankton functional groups and theoretical relationships between particle size and sinking rate suggest that carbon export from the euphotic zone is more efficient when communities are dominated by large organisms. However, this hypothesis has never been tested against measured size spectra spanning the >5 orders of magnitude found in plankton communities. Using data from five ocean regions (California Current Ecosystem, North Pacific subtropical gyre, Costa Rica Dome, Gulf of Mexico, and Southern Ocean subtropical front), we quantified carbon-based plankton size spectra from heterotrophic bacteria to metazoan zooplankton (size class cutoffs varied slightly between regions) and their relationship to net primary production and sinking particle flux. Slopes of the normalized biomass size spectra (NBSS) varied from −1.6 to −1.2 (median slope of −1.4 equates to large 1–10 mm organisms having a biomass equal to only 7.6% of the biomass in small 1–10 μm organisms). Net primary production was positively correlated with the NBSS slope, with a particularly strong relationship in the microbial portion of the size spectra. While organic carbon export co-varied with NBSS slope, we found only weak evidence that export efficiency is related to plankton community size spectra. Multi-variate statistical analysis suggested that properties of the NBSS added no explanatory power over chlorophyll, primary production, and temperature. Rather, the results suggest that both plankton size spectra and carbon export increase with increasing system productivity."

## Key Points
- Normalized biomass size spectra (NBSS) slopes spanning bacteria to zooplankton ranged from −1.6 to −1.2 across diverse ocean regions

- Whole community NBSS slope, microbial NBSS slope, and zooplankton:microbe ratio were positively correlated with net primary production

- NBSS slope was positively correlated with sinking carbon export but was not significantly correlated with export efficiency

## Plain Language Summary
Plankton communities in the open ocean are incredibly diverse taxonomically and with respect to size. They include bacteria smaller than 0.5 µm and metazoan zooplankton greater than 10-cm long. Organism size puts strong physiological constraints on many species; hence, changes in the relative sizes of plankton communities are predicted to correlate with important ecosystem functions, including photosynthesis rates, efficiency of food-web energy transfer, and carbon sequestration in the deep ocean by sinking organic particles. However, few studies have quantified the full size spectra of plankton communities across different marine ecosystems and none have concurrently measured photosynthesis and carbon export rates. We compiled plankton size spectra from the tropics to the Southern Ocean using consistent methods for bacteria, protists, and multicellular zooplankton. Size spectra slopes, which compare the relative biomass of large and small organisms, are slightly less than negative one, indicating that larger size classes contain less biomass than smaller ones. Ecosystems with higher photosynthetic rates are dominated by larger organisms and support a stronger biological carbon pump, transporting more carbon to the deep ocean. However, at similar levels of productivity, ecosystems with larger organisms do not transport significantly more carbon to the deep ocean than those dominated by smaller plankton.
