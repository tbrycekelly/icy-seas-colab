abstract = "The highly stratified, oligotrophic regions of the oceans are predominantly nitrogen limited in the surface ocean and light limited at the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM). Hence, determining light and nitrogen co-limitation patterns for diverse phytoplankton taxa is crucial to understanding marine primary production throughout the euphotic zone. During two cruises in the deep-water Gulf of Mexico, we measured primary productivity ($H^{13}CO_3^−$), nitrate uptake ($^{15}NO_{3}^{−}$) and ammonium uptake ($^{15}NH_{4}^{+}$) throughout the water column. Primary productivity declined with depth from the mixed layer to the DCM, averaging 27.1 $mmol C m^{−2} d^{−1}$. The fraction of growth supported by $NO_3^−$ was consistently low, with upper euphotic zone values ranging from 0.01 to 0.14 and lower euphotic zone values ranging from 0.03 to 0.44. Nitrate uptake showed strong diel patterns (maximum during the day), whereas ammonium uptake exhibited no diel variability. To parameterize taxon-specific phytoplankton nutrient and light utilization, we used a data assimilation approach (Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo) including primary productivity, nutrient uptake and taxon-specific growth rate measurements. Parameters derived from this analysis define distinct niches for five phytoplankton taxa (Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus, diatoms, dinoflagellates and prymnesiophytes) and may be useful for constraining biogeochemical models of oligotrophic open-ocean systems."
