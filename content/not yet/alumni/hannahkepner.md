Residing in the Bay Area, California and former computer science student turned geoscientist. I am highly interested in the plethora of applications that computer science has within the field of oceanography. I am currently working on two projects (1) a universally implemented production model for the Gulf of Alaska, and (2) a machine-learning approach to identifying and quantifying morphological features and ornamentation in ammonoid shells. When not working on research and studying, I enjoy going to the gym, hikes, and weekend golf games.
