Reliable evidence of changes in the marine environment have been reported in the Arctic Ocean during the last several
decades. Recent reductions in Arctic sea-ice cover have been most pronounced in the continental shelf region of the
Pacific Arctic, accompanied by increased ocean temperature, freshwater content, and Pacific Water inflow. These
variations influence on the phytoplankton community and subsequently, on the higher trophic levels.

My research interests lie at the impact of these environmental changes on polar marine ecosystems. In particular, my
research uses satellite remote sensing to explore topics related to:

1. Phytoplankton community dynamics
2. Shifts in phytoplankton phenology
3. Physical-biological interactions
