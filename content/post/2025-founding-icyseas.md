Although **Icy Seas Co-Lab** has been around in one form or another for the past couple of years, just recently we decided to take the full step of incorporating into _Icy Seas Co-Laboratory LLC_. We did this for two reasons: adaptability and teamwork. By distancing ourselves from university activities, we gain **adaptability** with respect to the projects we take on, the timeframe between project start and project conclusion, and allow for a wider variety of services. Similarly we find that Icy Seas Co-Laboratory can be a **better partner** and be more responsive to colleagues, clients, and community members as a primary business.

> As a research consultancy, we strive to be a leading model for university-private partnerships.

## Examples of partnerships
1. **Development of a data product.** University researcher has generated datasets through sponsored research activities and needs to generate a final data product. They contract _Icy Seas Co-Lab_ as a contractor to develop and supply a data product.
2. **Subaward for model analysis.** Icy Seas Co-Lab provides a university researcher with a statement of work (SOW) and provides required paperwork to the university's grants development office. Icy Seas Co-Lab collaborates with the university researchers for the duration of the project.
3. **Co-investigator on NSF project.** For a collaborative, multi-institute proposal, Icy Seas Co-Lab submits a proposal along with university researchers. Either institute could be prime. _(Not all RFPs allow for for-profit corporations to respond, but many do.)_
4. **Data management for project.** University researchers need a modern and functional data management pipeline for their project. Icy Seas Co-Lab is contracted to provide a data integration platform, to facilitate data submission, and to work with researchers throughout the process.

This list is far from an exhaustive listing of the types of collaborations and partnerships that Icy Seas Co-Lab can maintain with university researchers but it is a starting point. See our [pricing table here](/docs/services/).
