Here we propose a new study of the NGA in conjunction with the Northern Gulf of Alaska LTER program to assess carbon cycling
dynamics from coastal margins to the open ocean. To complete this, samples will be collected by Dr. Tom
Kelly (co-PI, NGA LTER) and undergraduate student Ryan Owens who have frequently participated in
research cruises in the region. This established relationship will ensure that shipboard time is available
and will build future collaborations for the continuation of this long-term study of DOM cycling in the
NGA. Laboratory analyses will be conducted by Ryan Owens and Dr. Johnston to characterize DOM. The
methods proposed will be conducted with instrumentation available at UAF using established protocols.

We anticipate that all laboratory analyses will be completed in late summer of 2024 and will conduct data
processing in late 2024 and prepare at least one publication for submission during this time. Through the
NGA LTER, paired measurements will be conducted including macronutrient concentrations (i.e. nitrate,
silicate, phosphate), particulate organic matter (inc. 13C and 15N), and salinity/temperature. Dr. David
Butman (Co-PI UW) has extensive knowledge of remote sensing linkages to landscape processes and will
host Ryan Owens in his lab to learn both stable isotope analyses and remote sensing linkages to prepare
for the next phases of this work. We anticipate the results from this collaboration to build the foundation
for a model of remote sensing, DOM composition and parameters routinely measured through the NGA
LTER.
