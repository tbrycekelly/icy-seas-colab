The Siberian sector of the Arctic Ocean (henceforth, “Siberian sector”) is influenced by the presence of both Pacific and Atlantic origin waters. Here, freshwater discharge from the major Siberian rivers starts its journey into the lower-latitude basins. Climatic changes in the Siberian Sector are among the strongest in the Arctic, yet biological observations in the region are scarce and insufficient for meaningful interpretation of these complex changes. We intend to leverage an existing cruises in the Siberian sector to increase ecosystem and biogeochemical observation in the region. This is pilot phase for what is envisioned as a long-term observational system within the larger pan-Arctic distributed biological observatory network. We aim to improve observational capacity for ecosystem level measurements by leveraging international and multidisciplinary teamwork. Motivated by regional idiosyncrasies, observations in the S-DBO region will be tailored for pan-Arctic synthesis in collaboration with other regional DBOs.


1. Establish observations in the region that may be used to identify signs of **borealization** and predict the influence of changing marine communities. 
2. Monitor changes to pelagic **food webs** in response to changing (1) sea-ice conditions, (2) enhanced turbulence, and (3) warmer surface waters, and connect these changes to forecasting future Arctic ecoscapes.  
3. Engage with **communities of the Arctic** and build lasting partnerships whereby the program can benefit from a diversity of voices and viewpoints. 



### Motivation

> To facilitate international  partnerships committed to improving and sustaining long-term ecological observations in the Siberian Arctic Ocean region for the purpose of understanding, detecting, and predicting the impacts of climate change. 

The Siberian sector of the Arctic Ocean is experiencing rapid physical changes that are likely associated in the ecosystem, but ecosystem monitoring in the area is far behind physical monitoring. Characterize ecosystem parameters across the spatial extent of the Siberian Arctic Ocean to benchmark the system and identify priorities for future research.  Coordinate process- and rate-oriented measurements, in addition to abundance and quantity measurements, to facilitate a snapshot of the regional food web.  The pilot program will contribute to a set of community standards for observations, data management, and collaboration-building; the development of these standards will be conducted with other Arctic Ocean observing networks. 

We do this is in the Siberian Arctic Ocean because we know so little about this region. Here is a summary of posted datasets on the US Arctic Data Center:

### The S-DBO

With the goal of creating long-term time series for change detection in the Pacific Arctic region, the Distributed Biological Observatory identified common observational parameters across agencies and nations and made commitments to collaboratively observe, share data, and synthesize research in the region. The original Distributed Biological Observatory is implemented in the Bering, Chukchi and Beaufort Seas and involves partnerships between the United States, Canada, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and China . The US component of the DBO receives funding from multiple programs including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the North Pacific Research Board, and the National Science Foundation. 

The original Distributed Biological Observatory selected sampling regions by referencing satellite data and determining biological hot-spots, as well as leveraging existing transects from prior cruises. In each selected region (originally 5 areas) a transect was established and repeat observations are made at designated stations. Partners may sample individual samples or repeat the established transect. Program planning and collaboration-building is managed via twice-annual meetings with the Pacific Arctic Group, as well as opportunistic meetings at internationally attended conferences.

More information and access to NSF-funded data from the original DBO can be found at their website .

The Siberian sector of the Arctic Ocean extends from the Chukchi Sea to the Kara Sea (roughly Wrangel Island to Severnaya Zemlya ). The proposed key transects in the early phases include: a shelf to basin transect starting on the East Siberian Sea shelf, mooring stations spaced along the continental slope, a transect at the Lomonosov Ridge extending into the Nansen Basin, and a transect at the Laptev Sea slope extending into the Basin. All transects and station are currently outside of the Russian Exclusive Economic Zone.
