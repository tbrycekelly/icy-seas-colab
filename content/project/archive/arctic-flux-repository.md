+++

The Arctic Flux Repository (AFR) is a shared resource for the research community to promote long-term and shared discovery about Arctic biogeochemical cycles. What sets this program apart from other biogeochemical surveys of the marine environment is the collection and distribution of physical sample material.

### Locations of Interest
This project proposes to establish standard operating procedures (SOP) for the collection, preservation, and sharing of sedimentation samples collected in the Arctic marine system. As such, initial efforts will leverage established time series in the Pacific Arctic (i.e. Bering Sea, Chukchi Sea, Beaufort Sea, and Siberian Sea; Figure 2). While no long term Arctic progams have included gravitational flux as priority measurements, several programs have opportunistically deployed sediment traps. The Nansen and Amundsen Basin observational system (NABOS) successfully deployed a moored sediment trap in XXXX, the first and only sediment trap of their 20 year history. Similarly, the distributed biological observational system (DBO) has operated in the Bering and Chukchi Seas for XX years and has recently added moored sediment traps to several study sites (Figure 2). 

### Our Vision
This project seeks to support continued redeployments of sediment traps where possible; while simultaneously enhancing spatial coverage across the rapidly changing Pacific Arctic through the NABOS and S-DBO programs. 

An obstacle to maintaining the status quo–a patchwork of programs, institutes, funding models, and PIs–is that while many successful deployments are conducted, resources for processing and maintenance of the samples is lacking. This is partially a financial issue, where analysis costs were not included (e.g. equipment only grants), and partially a structural issue stemming from the menagerie of projects that add capacity while not being unified in their approach.

The AFR project aims to alleviate these obstacles by establishing a uniform sample lifecycle (e.g. collection, storage, processing, archiving) to improve sample access, data generation, and dataset interoperability. 

### Project Organization
The project currently consists of three PIs and several students.
