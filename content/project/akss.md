Alaska Science Stories is an educational program that creates space for shared research and learning experiences by bringing Alaskans into the world of scientific fieldwork with virtual reality.

We facilitate impactful in-class learning that empowers Alaskans to feel involved and autonomous in their environment. 

Our program is builds bridges between Alaskans and their local research community with immersive and interactive storytelling designed to reach those who are impacted by climate change but not at the forefront of science outreach.
