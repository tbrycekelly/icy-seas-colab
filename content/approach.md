# Our Approach

## Philosophy
At **Icy Seas Co-Laboratory LLC**, we believe that effective science consulting blends rigorous analysis with transparency and collaboration.  
Our approach emphasizes:
- **Reproducibility** – clear, documented workflows that can be revisited and reused.
- **Flexibility** – tailoring solutions to the unique needs of each partner.
- **Clarity** – turning complex datasets and models into actionable insights.
- **Collaboration** – building long-term relationships with communities, agencies, and research groups.

## Workflow
Our typical workflow follows these steps:

1. **Discovery & Scoping** – understanding your goals, needs, and existing resources.  
2. **Data Integration** – organizing and structuring datasets (field, model, and observational).  
3. **Analysis & Modeling** – applying statistical and computational techniques.  
4. **Interpretation** – translating results into clear reports, visualizations, and recommendations.  
5. **Delivery & Support** – sharing final products and providing training or long-term support as needed.  

This workflow is designed to be iterative, with opportunities for feedback at every stage.
