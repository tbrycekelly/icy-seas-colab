# Mission

At Icy Seas Co-Laboratory LLC, our mission is to bridge science, technology, and community to advance understanding of our changing oceans. We combine rigorous research, innovative data tools, and collaborative partnerships to transform complex information into actionable knowledge. By making science transparent, reproducible, and accessible, we empower decision-makers, support Indigenous and local communities, and contribute to resilient ecosystems in the Arctic and beyond.

### Philosophy
At **Icy Seas Co-Laboratory LLC**, we believe that effective science consulting blends rigorous analysis with transparency and collaboration.  
Our approach emphasizes:
- **Reproducibility** – clear, documented workflows that can be revisited and reused.
- **Flexibility** – tailoring solutions to the unique needs of each partner.
- **Clarity** – turning complex datasets and models into actionable insights.
- **Collaboration** – building long-term relationships with communities, agencies, and research groups.

### Workflow
Our typical workflow follows these steps:

1. **Discovery & Scoping** – understanding your goals, needs, and existing resources.  
2. **Data Integration** – organizing and structuring datasets (field, model, and observational).  
3. **Analysis & Modeling** – applying statistical and computational techniques.  
4. **Interpretation** – translating results into clear reports, visualizations, and recommendations.  
5. **Delivery & Support** – sharing final products and providing training or long-term support as needed.  

This workflow is designed to be iterative, with opportunities for feedback at every stage.

### Tools We Use
We use open-source and industry-standard tools to ensure reproducibility and accessibility:  

- **Programming & Analysis:** Python, R, Julia  
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite  
- **Modeling & Simulation:** Numerical ocean models, machine learning workflows  
- **Collaboration:** GitHub, Jupyter, R Shiny, interactive dashboards  
- **Infrastructure:** Cloud platforms, HPC clusters, and self-hosted secure servers
