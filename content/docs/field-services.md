Field services are provided directly by Icy Seas Co-Lab founder, Dr. Thomas Kelly. Dr. Kelly has over 500 days of field work experience across five oceans. Dr. Kelly has led and supported expeditions from the poles to the tropics, working aboard research vessels, small boats, and autonomous platforms. He has conducted numerous biological incubations, lead high resolution sensor deployments, and managed teams under challenging circumstances.

This combination of technical skill, leadership, and cross-disciplinary experience allows **Icy Seas Co-Lab** to offer reliable, adaptable field support for projects in challenging marine environments.

### Water Sampling
> **Chlorophyll**: discrete sampling and extracted chlorophyll-*a* processing. 
>
> **Macronutrient Concentrations**: discrete samples. Analysis performed at the *International Arctic Research Center*.
>
> **Dissolved Trace Element & Metal Concentrations**: discrete samples. Analysis performed at the *International Arctic Research Center*.
>
> **Dissolved Oxygen Concentrations**: discrete samples and on-site Winkler titrations. 


### Biological Rates
> **Nitrate Uptake Rates**: via 15N-nitrate incorporation.
> 
> **Ammonium Uptake Rates**: via 15N-ammonium incorporation.
> 
> **Net Primary Production**: via 13C-bicarbonate incorporation.


### Technical & Advanced Instrumentation
> **Towed Imaging Systems**: realtime, high-throughput processing of image data.
> 
> **Custom Control Systems**: a variety of electronic control systems combined with simple user interfaces and controls.


### Technical Support
> **Real-time Dashboards**: *for example*, our FixPoint event logging system used on some UNOLS vessels.
> 
> **On-board data processing pipelines**: permitting situational awareness and local context via integration of remote sensing and on-board instrumentation.
