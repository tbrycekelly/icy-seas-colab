Centered on Arctic Ocean dynamics, I study several trace elements to assess their utility as indicators of circulation and biogeochemical processes. At the University of Alaska Fairbanks, I research biogeochemical cycling of nutrients, tracers of water mass mixing, and the connectivity between the sea ice system and the water column. Iâ€™m further interested in how the broad Arctic Ocean continental margins influence oceanographic biogeochemical cycles and the connectivity of the land-sea interface.
