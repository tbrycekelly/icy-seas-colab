I am a geoscience undergraduate with my concentration in geophysics. My academic journey first began in biology, until I discovered my true passion of understanding the Earth through geosciences. I am interested in oceanography research as it excavates insights about processes of the natural world. My goal is to develop my skills of understanding of systems through data analysis and modeling techniques. Outside of my studies, I find inspiration in nature adventures and a good cup of coffee.
