I am a geoscience undergraduate concentrating in geophysics, actuated by a passion for understanding Earth's natural systems. My academic journey began in biology and ultimately led me to geosciences. Iâ€™m particularly drawn to oceanography research, using computational methods to interpret patterns, systems, and interactions in the natural world. Outside the lab, I find inspiration in outdoor exploration and a good cup of coffee.
