I’m an oceanographer and founder of Icy Seas Co-Laboratory. I am also Affiliate Professor at the International Arctic Research Center. The ocean is an amazing place, and I am excited to share my science of the ocean with you. I study how marine ecosystems interact with their physical environment. When not working I spend most of my time either on house projects or with my family our on a trail.

I founded Icy Seas Co-Laboratory to create a space where science, technology, and community meet on equal footing. After years of working in academic oceanography, I saw the need for an organization that could move more nimbly-bridging rigorous research with open-source tools, transparent data systems, and meaningful collaboration across the Arctic. I wanted to build a platform that empowers scientists, students, and local observers alike to engage directly with the data and models shaping our understanding of the changing ocean.

Icy Seas Co-Lab is rooted in the belief that open science is not just a principle but a practice—that the tools we build, the data we share, and the collaborations we form should all contribute to a more connected, informed, and resilient Arctic research community.


### Research Overview
My research is first and foremost synthetic, using physical samples and experiments at sea to ground both the hypotheses and tools I use. I then construct models of the marine system to learn more about how my data connects to other components of the ocean, such as the food web, and then to explore how the system works.

Ultimately I am always interested in learning new approaches and working together to build the next new innovation in earth systems and oceanography.
