Dr. Gwenn Hennon is an Assistant Professor at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Gwenn loves the way phytoplankton are both astonishingly beautiful and globally important. She wants to be able to predict phytoplankton community composition in the future ocean and understand how microbial interactions may shift.

Her hobbies include cross-country skiing, paddle boarding, and hiking with her husband and two kids.

### Research Overview
The Hennon Lab is based at the University of Alaska Fairbanks where we culture phytoplankton and sequence marine microbes to understand how climate change impacts them. Our field work takes us all over the state of Alaska including Kachemak Bay, Lynn Canal, the Gulf of Alaska and up to the Arctic. We also collect samples in the sub-tropics in places such as Bermuda to understand how phytoplankton in nutrient poor regions will be impacted by ocean acidification.

Our goal is to uncover how phytoplankton populations will acclimate and adapt to changes in CO2, temperature, and sea ice conditions predicted for future decades. Our work is organism focused but we love to collaborate broadly with biogeochemists and ecological modelers to put our organisms in the broader context.
