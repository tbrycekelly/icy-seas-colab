      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dr. Gwenn Hennon is an Assistant Professor at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Gwenn loves the way phytoplankton are both astonishingly beautiful and globally important. She wants to be able to predict phytoplankton community composition in the future ocean and understand how microbial interactions may shift.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Her hobbies include cross-country skiing, paddle boarding, and hiking with her husband and two kids.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;research-overview&#34;&gt;Research Overview&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Hennon Lab is based at the University of Alaska Fairbanks where we culture phytoplankton and sequence marine microbes to understand how climate change impacts them. Our field work takes us all over the state of Alaska including Kachemak Bay, Lynn Canal, the Gulf of Alaska and up to the Arctic. We also collect samples in the sub-tropics in places such as Bermuda to understand how phytoplankton in nutrient poor regions will be impacted by ocean acidification.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A chemical engineering undergraduate at UAF, and now gone on to continue her degree at Georgia Tech, Amelia was a valued member of the lab. She focused on processing sediment trap samples for carbon and nitrogen analysis, as well as engaging local middle school and high school students via Alaska Science Stories.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a geoscience undergraduate concentrating in geophysics, actuated by a passion for understanding Earth&amp;rsquo;s natural systems. My academic journey began in biology and ultimately led me to geosciences. Iâ€™m particularly drawn to oceanography research, using computational methods to interpret patterns, systems, and interactions in the natural world. Outside the lab, I find inspiration in outdoor exploration and a good cup of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Residing in the Bay Area, California and former computer science student turned geoscientist. I am highly interested in the plethora of applications that computer science has within the field of oceanography. I am currently working on two projects (1) a universally implemented production model for the Gulf of Alaska, and (2) a machine-learning approach to identifying and quantifying morphological features and ornamentation in ammonoid shells. When not working on research and studying, I enjoy going to the gym, hikes, and weekend golf games.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A geoscience undergraduate, I am interested in the ocean for its physical and chemical properties and currently leads the &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/project/arctic-flux-repository/&#34;&gt;Arctic Flux Repository&lt;/a&gt;. I hope to shed light on the state of oceans in the arctic through my work in the logistical and procedural handling of large volumes of sediment samples to better aid in our understanding of the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
