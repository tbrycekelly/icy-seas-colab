      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although &lt;strong&gt;Icy Seas Co-Lab&lt;/strong&gt; has been around in one form or another for the past couple of years, just recently we decided to take the full step of incorporating into &lt;em&gt;Icy Seas Co-Laboratory LLC&lt;/em&gt;. We did this for two reasons: adaptability and teamwork. By distancing ourselves from university activities, we gain &lt;strong&gt;adaptability&lt;/strong&gt; with respect to the projects we take on, the timeframe between project start and project conclusion, and allow for a wider variety of services. Similarly we find that Icy Seas Co-Laboratory can be a &lt;strong&gt;better partner&lt;/strong&gt; and be more responsive to colleagues, clients, and community members as a primary business.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
