      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although &lt;strong&gt;Icy Seas Co-Lab&lt;/strong&gt; has been around in one form or another for the past couple of years, just recently we decided to take the full step of incorporating into &lt;em&gt;Icy Seas Co-Laboratory LLC&lt;/em&gt;. We did this for two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a research consultancy, we strive to be a leading model for university-private partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;examples-of-partnerships&#34;&gt;Examples of partnerships&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Development of a data product.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subaward for model analysis.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Co-investigator on NSF project.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data management for project.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This list is far from an exhaustive listing of the types of collaborations and partnerships that Icy Seas Co-Lab can maintain with university researchers but it is a starting point.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Retrieving data from the bottom of the ocean: OCR for ROV</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/post/2024-ocr/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When advising students about their career goals, paths forward, and expectations; I often recommend that they consider learning a program language. While the language itself depends on the goals and background of the person, being able to work directly with data is powerful. Today’s project is a good example of just such a case.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A colleague approached me to see if I could help pull data off some video files since the original data had been lost. For context, these video files were collected as part of a deep-sea survey of marine organisms with many hours of footage collected by a remotely operated vehicle (ROV). Attached to the ROV are a number of sensors besides the camera–such as pressure, temperature, and salinity; and it was some of those sensor feeds that are lost to time. Luckily for us, the data feeds were directly overlaid into the feed feed. So all we need to do is pull some numbers from the video, how hard could that be?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>NGA Phase 2 Process Studies</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/post/2023-nga-phase-2/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Transitioning from the first funding cycle of an LTER site (phase 1) to the second come with a lot of considerations and opportunities. Phase 1 has largely focused on survey and monitoring work where the emphasis was clearly on maintaining and expanding existing time series (e.g., Sewardline). While there were some process studies, those activities that try to interrogate the flows of energy and interactions between members of the ecosystem, they were generally quite resource limited and short on time (2-4 days). As someone that comes from a process study background (for reference, the California Current Ecosystem LTER site has entire 30-35 day cruises focused entirely on processes), I knew I wanted to advocate for expanded process work in Phase 2.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INDITUN: Trophic ecology of southern bluefun tuna larvae in the North-eastern Indian Ocean&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://prezi.com/p/cwcenyucvuiu/inditun-20/&#34;&gt;INDITUN is a collaborative project&lt;/a&gt; funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation to compile and synthesize data collected over the past few years on Bluefin Tuna Larvae growth and survival. This project connects naturally with &lt;a href=&#34;https://academic.oup.com/plankt/article/44/5/600/6645206&#34;&gt;BLOOFINZ-GOM&lt;/a&gt; (Gulf of Mexico) and BLOOFINZ-IO (Indian Ocean) conducted between 2017 and 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/inditun/inditun1.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During the BLOOFINZ-GOM project I was a student at Florida State University and was in charge of phytoplankton growth, nutrient utilization, and export production. Then for the BLOOFINZ-IO cruise I was a postdoc working on trace metal distributions and export from the euphotic zone. For the INDITUN project (unfunded collaborator) I’ll facilitate data compilation and provide an oceanographic context for the assessment of larval dynamics, which are often associated with mesoscale features.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last year the OCE directorate at the National Science Foundation reinstated their postdoctoral research fellowship program whereby applicants vie for two years of postdoctoral salary and a small research budget. This program supports a wide range of early career researchers (ECR) and allows many to pursue exciting, and potentially novel research. I am proud and thankful to say that I’ve been afforded one of these opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a carbon biogeochemist, my project centers of direct observations of particle export (via sediment traps) within the Northern Gulf of Alaska. Sinking bits of carbon, commonly referred to as marine snow, are important for (A) supplying organic matter to ecosystems in the deep ocean, (B) removing carbon and nutrients from the surface ocean, and (C) our understanding of how chemical and biological transformations interaction within the physical ocean.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>NGA LTER Summer Voyage: Biogeochemistry Section Report</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;optical-instruments&#34;&gt;Optical Instruments&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two rosette-mounted optical instruments were used during the cruise: the underwater vision profiler (Hydroptic UVP5; sn009) and the laser in situ scatterometer and transmissometer (Sequoia LISST-200x; sn2167). Both instruments measure particle abundance and size spectra during the downcast. The UVP5 was used on almost all casts (n = 68) and assesses particles between ~250 – 2500 µm while the LISST-200x was used on shallow casts (600m depth rating; n = 46) and quantifies particles into 36 size classes between 1 – 500 µm. Blanks for the LISST-200x (milli-q water) were consistently low and in line with factory calibration values. The LISST-200x was also used onboard the towed DPI instrument during tow-yo transects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During the cruise 6 deployments of the surface-tethered sediment trap arrays were completed with a target duration of 24h. Deployments were conducted across a representative set of pelagic stations (KOD5, KOD9, MID10, GAK4, GAK8, and GAK15) in order to measure gravitationally settling organic matter quantity and quality. Each array was outfitted with 2-3 cross-frames placed (1) near the base of the euphotic zone at 40 m, (2) 100 m, and 180 m (when water depth permitted). Four collection tubes per depth allowed for replicate sampling for Chl-a (n = 60) and carbon and nitrogen abundance and isotopic composition (n = 90) of sinking matter. Additionally, samples for biogenic silica were collected from one tube per depth (n = 15). Use of a 5m spar buoy, SPOT satellite beacon, and strobe light permitted efficient recovery. Pigment fluxes have been calculated for all sediment trap deployments (Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>About Thorium</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a short blurb put together for the participants of a research voyage down to Antarctica, which I participated on in Jan 2020. I wanted to share one of the projects I was completing with a relatively general audience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;about-thorium&#34;&gt;About Thorium&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thorium-234, an isotope of Thorium, has found popular use as a tracer of ecological processes and is actually measured by dozens of labs around the world. Thorium-234, which has a half-life of 24 days, is a daughter radionuclide of Uranium-238 which itself has a half-life of 3.8 billion years. Since Uranium-238 has a very long half-life and is quite soluble in seawater, U-238 concentrations in seawater are nearly the same everywhere and can be predicted given the salinity. Thorium-234, on the other hand, has a short half-life and is generally in-soluble in seawater. In fact, Thorium will rapidly bind to the surfaces of organic matter in seawater. Thus, as organic particles sink out of the surface ocean, they efficiently remove Thorium-234.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Interpolating Bathymetry To Unstructured Mesh</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks (perhaps months) ago I introduced the side project that I am involved with whereby our aim is to develop a hydrographic model for Apalachicola Bay, Fl. Today I wanted to provide an update for that project while also sharing some interesting problems that we’ve had to work around.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/2016-unstructured-mesh/figure1.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The last we spoke, we had decided on using FVCOM to model the bay and surrounding waters. Our choice was contingent on having a model that could accurately describe the complex coastline and relatively flat and shallow water column. FVCOM uses an unstructured mesh, meaning that instead of using a grid with a regular pattern (think Manhattan’s streets and avenues), the model domain is instead more freeform (think rural street map). This offered both the possibility for improved spatial resolution and an opportunity for use all to gain proficiency in a new skill.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
