        <div class="article-style" itemprop="articleBody">
            <h2 id="overview">OVERVIEW</h2>
<p>The Northern Gulf of Alaska (NGA) is a highly productive subarctic marine ecosystem sustaining one of the world’s largest fisheries, iconic high latitude species, ecotourism, cultural continuity, and food security for coastal communities. The NGA LTER overarching conceptual framework is that intense environmental variability – both temporally and spatially – has yielded a highly resilient ecosystem through species adaptation and community organization. Building off 25 years of multidisciplinary observations along the Seward Line in LTER’s five core areas, NGA Phase-II seeks improved mechanistic understanding of this biome’s key communities, ecological processes, and responses to climate change. The NGA biome comprises a mosaic of habitats postulated to underlie the high productivity and resilience of the ecosystem. Phase-II studies and associated broader impacts will focus on growing and interpreting long-term data sets; studying functional redundancy in the context of disturbance and long-term change, as well as relationships between redundancy and resilience; and investigating oceanographic fronts, associated ecotones, and their combined role in supporting key ecosystem properties that generate resilience. We propose to tackle each element with a combination of observational methodologies, process studies, and modeling.</p>
<h2 id="intellectual-merit">INTELLECTUAL MERIT</h2>
<p>Building on long-term data sets for the region and findings from Phase-I, NGA Phase-II research has three primary goals. First, continue collection and analysis of long-term ecosystem data (abiotic and biotic) to better understand species abundance and connectivity, and their relationships to event-scale and long-term change. Second, explore functional redundancy as an underpinning of resilience. Despite a relatively modest species richness, the NGA hosts numerous instances of trophically comparable taxa throughout the foodweb; we posit that these taxa, with differing nutritional strategies, life histories, and phenological expression, comprise functional redundancy. This redundancy stabilizes variability at higher trophic levels, thereby conferring resilience (i.e., maintenance or recovery of key emergent ecosystem properties in response to disturbance). The degree to which redundancy stabilizes communities has not been well explored in pelagic marine ecosystems. Third, investigate the role of fronts and associated ecotones in the NGA. New technologies acquired during Phase-I can overcome historical limitations to the observation of fronts and their constituent communities at biologically relevant spatial and temporal scales. We hypothesize that fronts exert a disproportionate influence on key ecosystem properties (e.g., production, export, biological diversity) and are thus related to whole-ecosystem resilience. Further, fronts are likely to be influenced by event-scale and long-term environmental change. Our observations and experimentation under each of these three themes will be coupled to modeling activities that will parameterize the relevant physical and biological relationships, and will then use these biome-specific formulations to explore current and future climate scenarios predicted for the NGA. We will further explore ecological theory through collaboration with other LTER sites.</p>
<h2 id="broader-impacts">BROADER IMPACTS</h2>
<p>In the mid-1970s the NGA underwent an ecological regime shift into a new stable state that has persisted for over four decades. Such shifts have major relevance to national fisheries as well as local communities dependent on NGA ecosystem services. Understanding the resilience of the NGA to both short- and long- term change is of great relevance to all stakeholders in the region; accordingly, NGA science will continue to inform regional fisheries management through several of data products. The NGA is increasingly networked with schools locally and statewide, including programs for Alaska Native students. NGA is also building connections to local communities and Tribal governments, while striving to broaden participation at all levels within the site. The NGA Schoolyard program, proposed collaborations with other programs targeting under-represented groups, and our leveraged Teacher-at-Sea program provide an array of outreach opportunities with a strong diversity, equity and inclusion focus. University-level impact occurs through our interdisciplinary REU program, graduate student and early career scientist training. The importance of the NGA is reflected by the numerous agencies and organizations that contribute to, and in turn leverage, the NGA infrastructure.</p>
