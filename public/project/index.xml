      <title>Northern Gulf of Alaska LTER</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;OVERVIEW&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Northern Gulf of Alaska (NGA) is a highly productive subarctic marine ecosystem sustaining one of the world’s largest fisheries, iconic high latitude species, ecotourism, cultural continuity, and food security for coastal communities. The NGA LTER overarching conceptual framework is that intense environmental variability – both temporally and spatially – has yielded a highly resilient ecosystem through species adaptation and community organization. Building off 25 years of multidisciplinary observations along the Seward Line in LTER’s five core areas, NGA Phase-II seeks improved mechanistic understanding of this biome’s key communities, ecological processes, and responses to climate change. The NGA biome comprises a mosaic of habitats postulated to underlie the high productivity and resilience of the ecosystem. Phase-II studies and associated broader impacts will focus on growing and interpreting long-term data sets; studying functional redundancy in the context of disturbance and long-term change, as well as relationships between redundancy and resilience; and investigating oceanographic fronts, associated ecotones, and their combined role in supporting key ecosystem properties that generate resilience. We propose to tackle each element with a combination of observational methodologies, process studies, and modeling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Alaska Science Stories is an educational program that creates space for shared research and learning experiences by bringing Alaskans into the world of scientific fieldwork with virtual reality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We facilitate impactful in-class learning that empowers Alaskans to feel involved and autonomous in their environment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our program is builds bridges between Alaskans and their local research community with immersive and interactive storytelling designed to reach those who are impacted by climate change but not at the forefront of science outreach.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Collaboration: DOC in Coastal Alaska</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here we propose a new study of the NGA in conjunction with the Northern Gulf of Alaska LTER program to assess carbon cycling&#xA;dynamics from coastal margins to the open ocean. To complete this, samples will be collected by Dr. Tom&#xA;Kelly (co-PI, NGA LTER) and undergraduate student Ryan Owens who have frequently participated in&#xA;research cruises in the region. This established relationship will ensure that shipboard time is available&#xA;and will build future collaborations for the continuation of this long-term study of DOM cycling in the&#xA;NGA. Laboratory analyses will be conducted by Ryan Owens and Dr. Johnston to characterize DOM. The&#xA;methods proposed will be conducted with instrumentation available at UAF using established protocols.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Siberian DBO</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Siberian sector of the Arctic Ocean (henceforth, “Siberian sector”) is influenced by the presence of both Pacific and Atlantic origin waters. Here, freshwater discharge from the major Siberian rivers starts its journey into the lower-latitude basins. Climatic changes in the Siberian Sector are among the strongest in the Arctic, yet biological observations in the region are scarce and insufficient for meaningful interpretation of these complex changes. We intend to leverage an existing cruises in the Siberian sector to increase ecosystem and biogeochemical observation in the region. This is pilot phase for what is envisioned as a long-term observational system within the larger pan-Arctic distributed biological observatory network. We aim to improve observational capacity for ecosystem level measurements by leveraging international and multidisciplinary teamwork. Motivated by regional idiosyncrasies, observations in the S-DBO region will be tailored for pan-Arctic synthesis in collaboration with other regional DBOs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Arctic Flux Repository</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Arctic Flux Repository (AFR) is a shared resource for the research community to promote long-term and shared discovery about Arctic biogeochemical cycles. What sets this program apart from other biogeochemical surveys of the marine environment is the collection and distribution of physical sample material.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;locations-of-interest&#34;&gt;Locations of Interest&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This project proposes to establish standard operating procedures (SOP) for the collection, preservation, and sharing of sedimentation samples collected in the Arctic marine system. As such, initial efforts will leverage established time series in the Pacific Arctic (i.e. Bering Sea, Chukchi Sea, Beaufort Sea, and Siberian Sea; Figure 2). While no long term Arctic progams have included gravitational flux as priority measurements, several programs have opportunistically deployed sediment traps. The Nansen and Amundsen Basin observational system (NABOS) successfully deployed a moored sediment trap in XXXX, the first and only sediment trap of their 20 year history. Similarly, the distributed biological observational system (DBO) has operated in the Bering and Chukchi Seas for XX years and has recently added moored sediment traps to several study sites (Figure 2).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
