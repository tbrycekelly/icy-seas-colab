      <description>&lt;p&gt;A chemical engineering undergraduate at UAF, and now gone on to continue her degree at Georgia Tech, Amelia was a valued member of the lab. She focused on processing sediment trap samples for carbon and nitrogen analysis, as well as engaging local middle school and high school students via Alaska Science Stories.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Residing in the Bay Area, California and former computer science student turned geoscientist. I am highly interested in the plethora of applications that computer science has within the field of oceanography. I am currently working on two projects (1) a universally implemented production model for the Gulf of Alaska, and (2) a machine-learning approach to identifying and quantifying morphological features and ornamentation in ammonoid shells. When not working on research and studying, I enjoy going to the gym, hikes, and weekend golf games.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
